# ü§î Background
xchainshop was developed to streamline and modernize the ordering and payment process, particularly in overseas settings where traditional methods can be cumbersome. In many countries, ordering involves slow-paced interactions between customers and waitstaff, with additional hassles like separate cash tips. xchainshop addresses these challenges by enabling customers to scan a QR code at their table, browse the menu at their own pace, and place orders without unnecessary interactions.

Once the order is placed, customers can **quickly and accurately pay using cryptocurrency or credit cards, including tips, all in one step.** This not only simplifies the payment process but also eliminates the need for cash handling.

For restaurants, xchainshop reduces the workload on waitstaff by eliminating the need for them to take **orders manually, minimizing errors and confusion.** Payments are processed in real-time, **simplifying the settlement process and reducing the reliance on cash.** **Cryptocurrency payments also offer lower fees compared to credit cards, potentially boosting profits by 1-2%.** Additionally, the use of blockchain technology ensures that revenue data is secure from manipulation, offering restaurants a **trustworthy and efficient payment system.**

In essence, xchainshop enhances convenience and security for both customers and restaurants, providing a forward-thinking solution that meets the needs of the modern dining experience.

  Getting Started
</summary>
<div markdown="1">
  
  This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
  
  ## Getting Started
  
  First, run the development server:
  
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  # or
  yarn dev
  # or
  pnpm dev
  # or
  bun dev
  ```
  
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
  
  You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
  
  This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
