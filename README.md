# ü§î Background
Xchain shop is a second-hand transaction service that is not widely used in overseas environments and is not yet active, but it would be good to utilize this in reverse to enter this blue ocean-like second-hand transaction P2P transaction platform for the first time and participate in a market where there is a lack of competitors, effectively and uniquely show our own service, and activate this P2P transaction a little more, and provide a way for users to easily make profits and resell various leftover products that are too good to throw away or new but unused products to make a little profit, or to quickly obtain necessary items from people and areas around them.

Therefore, rather than focusing on fundamental issues, we have seen a successful case in the Korean market where a GPS-based second-hand transaction service called Carrot Market was successful and well-operated, so this second-hand transaction service is being provided to introduce a cryptocurrency payment system in overseas markets, to be reborn, to challenge the overseas second-hand transaction market, and to help users easily purchase and obtain necessary products around them.

- **Sellers** simply write and upload the product name, description, price, image, and transaction details they want to sell.
- **Buyers** simply check the list of products they need and purchase them with cryptocurrency.

The payment method is cryptocurrency, and stable coins can be used for payment. In addition, since it provides multi-chain, it allows payments to be made regardless of the network.
